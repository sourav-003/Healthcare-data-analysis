# Healthcare-data-analysis
A healthcare capstone project analyzing patient encounter costs and predicting health risks using SQL and Power BI.
# Healthcare Data Analysis

This project is a comprehensive capstone focused on **Patient Encounter Cost and Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems**, aimed at improving clinical outcomes and optimizing healthcare resource allocation through data-driven insights.

## üìä Project Overview

Using historical healthcare datasets covering patients, encounters, procedures, payers, and organizations, the project leverages **SQL** for data preprocessing and **Power BI** for visualization to:

- Classify patient risk (Low, Medium, High)
- Analyze medical cost distribution
- Identify high-cost encounters and frequent procedures
- Correlate risk factors with demographics and chronic conditions

---

## üß† Key Objectives

- Predict and stratify patients based on health risk
- Analyze financial risk due to high-cost procedures and gaps in payer coverage
- Explore cost trends across encounter types, procedures, and organizations
- Generate insights for preventive care and policy decisions

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (MySQL)
- **Power BI**
- **Python** *(optional, for preprocessing if needed)*
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## üìå Insights & Recommendations

- Patients aged **60+** and those with **3+ chronic conditions** are disproportionately high-risk.
- Just **15.9% of patients** account for over **42% of medical costs**.
- Frequent visits, high procedure volume, and poor payer coverage drive cost spikes.
- Targeted **preventive care**, **chronic disease programs**, and **real-time EHR risk alerts** can reduce burden.
